# Scoundrel HP Tracker
A HP and high score tracker for the card game Scoundrel. Made half by me and half by Claude AI.

## How to use:
If you don't know how to play Scoundrel, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt2tYzM93h4)

When you run it, it will show you your current and starting HP, which is 20. You continue gameplay by putting in positive numbers to add to your HP and negative numbers to subtract from it. It will continue to ask you if the deck is empty. This is basically asking if the game is over or not, only if you survive. If your HP ever hits 0, it will automatically let you know that you died and ask you for the remaining monster card values, and will calculate your score. Once gameplay is over, it will calculate if you got a high score or not, and if so, it will tell you and make a text file (if you run it for the first time) or update the file.

### Enjoy!
